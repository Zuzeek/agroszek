        <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
        <p>The protection of internet–connected systems and computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software, electronic data, as well as from distribution or misdirection of the service they provide.</p>
        <h2>What is Cyber Atack?</h2>
        <p>A cyber attack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization. Usually, the attacker seeks some type of benefit from disrupting the victim’s network.</p>
        <h2>What is Cyber Threat?</h2>
        <p>Cyber threats are delivered by computers. They can vary significantly in their seriousness and applications. They range from website pop-ups to WannaCry.</p>
        <h2>Basic Nature</h2>
        <p>Most cyber attackers are looking to profit from security failures, hence most cyber attacks simply target who have left the digital doors unlocked.</p>

<!-- ============= Motives ============== -->

    <article>
      <p>Cyber attacks usually aim at:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information</li>
          <li>extorting money from users</li>
          <li>disruption of service</li>
          <li>ideology</li>
          <li>revenge</li>
          <li>espionage</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

<!-- ============= How Hackers get in? ============== -->
   <article>
      <h2>People</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stolen or weak passwords</li>
          <li>Employees clicking on infected phishing emails</li>
          <li>espionage</li>
          <li>third party supplier</li>
          <li>example Ticketmaster:
            <p>A supplier which operates a chatbot on the Ticketmaster site, customized its product by modifying a line of JS code. Ticketmaster then used this code on its payments page, where it was discovered by hackers and modified to extract payment information.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Unpatched and outdated windows operating systems.
            <p>e.g. WannaCry attack carried out in 2017. A global ransomware attack. Effected over 200,000 individuals, 10,000 organizations in over 150 countries and in the UK effecting NHS.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Web applications and pages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>SQL Injection – code (script) designed to steal, spy or harm.
            <p>e.g. Tickermaster or British Airways. The details were taken via a script designed to steal financial information by 'skimming' the payment page before it was submitted.</p>
          </li>

    <header>Main Features of threats to Individuals</header>
    <article>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Tracking – adverts following you from site to site.</li>
          <li>Data collection – variety of companies and services online can collect your browsing data or location data, e.g. google maps.</li>
          <li>Lack of security by websites and services user use, e.g. data breach to TalkTalk or My Fitness Pal.</li>
          <li>Public Wi-Fi – hackers can insert themselves between a user and the service impersonating the website a user wanted to visit, often leads to stealing users bank login and password.</li>
          <li>Social Networking – hackers carry out social engineering attack against a user and collects as much info about them as they can in order to impersonate a user.</li>
          <li>Government spying – internet service companies are forced by the law to collect metadata on their customers and hold it for 12 months, which could be examined by the government with the right warrants.</li>
        </ul>

      <header>Motives behind Cyber Threats</header>
        <article>
          <h2>Why hackers hack?</h2>
          <p>Hackers hack for a variety of different reasons.  Interestingly, ransom is a top motive at 41%. It seems that motives for hacking are gradually shifting over time. Fewer attacks for fun, ideology or grudge, and more attacks are increasingly tied to espionage.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Financial: Money, Profit, Ransom</li>
              <li>Fun</li>
              <li>Cyberwar</li>
              <li>Ideology</li>
              <li>Revenge, Grudge</li>
              <li>Disruption, Competition</li>
              <li>Espionage, Insider threat</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <img src="/img/motives.jpg" alt="Motives" />
          <br>

          <h2>Different types of sources of cybersecurity threats:</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><p><b>The Activist</b> promotes a political or religious agenda or a social change, so mainly use hacking to affect ideological change. Motivated by a desire to change something.</p>
            <p>For example, manipulation of electoral data in order to influence elections or a hack on Syrian Electronic Army.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>The Getaway</b> usually youngster, who are motivated by power, inclusion into a notorious group, thrill or simply to showcase their skills.</p>
            <p>For example, NHS attack by two young man or TalkTalk hack.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>The Insider</b> usually an inside man, an angry employee, ex-employee, contractor or supplier. Motivations could vary from greed, ideology, being naive or fear – someone is blackmailing them. The insider identifies vulnerabilities in a company’s security and exploit them.</p>
            <p>For example, Operation Socialist, where info about an attack was leaked by an inside man.</p></li>

            <li><b>The Mule</b> fraudster, naïve opportunist, used by attackers to launder cybercrime money and turn them into real money. Motivated by greed, desperation. Often work from home or cafes using local Wi-Fi.</li>

            <li><b>The Professional</b> career criminal, they usually work 9-5 at a legitimately looking criminal company. Their motivation is purely for financial gain.</li>
          </ul>

  <section id="analysis">
      <header>Analysis of the major threats and their mechanics</header>
        <article>
            <h2>Social engineering</h2>
            <p>A con. An attack involves tricking someone into giving over personal or company details that attackers can use to their advantage. For example, an attacker might impersonate a potential customer, IT technician or relay on human decency. Hacker targeting an online retailer might impersonate potential supplier or IT technician in order to trick people to let them into their office or building in order to exploit network vulnerabilities or trick people into disclosing login details.</p>

            <h2>Malware</h2>
            <p>Malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. It breaches a network through vulnerability, typically could be an email with a link or an attachment. When a user clicks a dangerous link or attachment that then installs harmful software. It could be spy software, malicious virus or worm.</p>

            <p><u>Once inside the system, malware can do the following:</u></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Can let an attacker to take control of your machine.</li>
            <li>Locks you out of your computer or network, asking for ransomware if you’d like to unlock it.</li>
            <li>Installs malware or harmful software.</li>
            <li>Install spyware and monitor your actions and keystrokes.</li>
            <li>Silently send confidential data from your computer or network to the attacker’s home base.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Example:</u> Zeus Trojan Horse in 2007</p>
            <ul><li>Compromised over 1 million accounts from Amazon, Bank of America and Cisco.</li>
            <li>used keystroke logging</li>
            <li>stolen $70 mil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p><u>What is it?</u></p>
            <p>Attacker attempts to trick a victim into sharing sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, credit card details, account information or trick you into downloading malicious malware. Very often phishing isn’t personalised to the victim and are usually sent to masses of people at the same time.</p>

            <p><u>How does it work?</u></p>
            <p>Victim receives a phony email or text message mimicking the identity of a trusted sender e.g.: PayPal, bank, online shop, your boss or someone who has loads of authority in the company. For example, the attacker may impersonate an email from the HR, creating the same signature layout as the company currently uses. Attacker sends out an email to everyone at the company, including a link or infected documents, e.g. employee satisfaction survey. The link in such email often leads to a website that will download malware to user’s computer, compromising their systems and security. Opening a backdoor for a hacker.</p>

            <p><u>Examples:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Storm worm attack in 2007. Severe storms swept over Europe. Users received a phony email with news updates about the storms. Tricking users to click on infected link.</li>
              <li>look-alike websites</li>
              <li>an email with deactivation of your account notice, asking you to fill in your credentials</li>
              <li>an email with an infected attachment that looks like it came from trusted source, e.g. your boss</li>
              <li>an email inviting you to join google docs</li>
              <li>an email containing 'Shipping information' with a link to trace your package</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Spear/Whale phishing</h2>
            <p><u>What is it?</u></p>
            <p>A targeted attempt to steal sensitive information such as account credentials or financial information from a specific victim (CEO or founders), often for malicious reasons.</p>

            <p><u>How does it work?</u></p>
            <p>This is achieved by acquiring personal details on the victim such as their friends, hometown, employer, locations they frequent, and what they have recently bought online. The attackers then disguise themselves as a trustworthy friend or entity to acquire sensitive information, typically through email or other online messaging. Spear phishing is the most successful form of acquiring confidential information on the internet, accounting for 91% of attacks.</p>

            <p><u>Examples:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Email with subject line "Shipping information" or "Account deactivated" etc. They look like they came from trusted source and very often will include a link taking you to a website with a malware.</li>
              <li>Fake emails that look like they came from CEO asking you to fill in your sensitive information, e.g. tax form</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SQL Injection attack</h2>
            <p>SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques, used to attack data-driven applications. In an SQL attack an attacker targets a vulnerable website to target its stored data, such as financial and user credentials.</p>

            <p><u>What is it?</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>SQL is a programming language that is used to communicate with databases.</li>
              <li>Exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database.</li>
              <li>An attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not, such as credit card info, user credentials or other sensitive information.</li>
              <li>An attacker can simply submit malicious code into a vulnerable website search box.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>How does it work?</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.</li>
                <li>SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><u>Examples:</u></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A Trojan horse that opens a backdoor in the computer which then allows it to be remotely controlled, while also installing a rootkit that hides the malicious program. As computers become infected, they become vulnerable to remote control by the person behind the attack. This worm also can update itself, so that updated infections can be fed into the compromised computer.</li>
                <li>Heartland Payment System attack in 2008:
                <ul>
                  <li>134 million credit cards exposed.</li>
                  <li>Breach was discovered after 10 months. Credit card companies noticed suspicious transactions from accounts Heartland processed.</li>
                  <li>Huge financial loss, as the company paid out $145m in compensation for fraudulent payments and wasn't allowed to process payments for 5 months.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Impact</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>to spoof identity</li>
              <li>tamper with existing data</li>
              <li>cause reputation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances</li>
              <li>allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system</li>
              <li>destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable</li>
              <li>become administrators of the database server</li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Man-in-the-Middle</h2>
            <p>An attacker inserts themselves into communication between two parties. Two parties believe they are communicating with each other, but really, they are communicating with an attacker.</p>
            <p><u>Two common points of entry:</u></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unsecure public Wi-Fi. An attacker can insert themselves between a visitor’s device and the network. Without knowing, the visitor passes all information through the attacker.</li>
                <li>Malware. Once malware has breached a device, an attacker can install software to process all the victim’s information.</li>
                </ul>

          <img src="/img/man.jpg" alt="Man-in-the-Middle" />

          <h2>Waterhole attacks</h2>
          <p>Although uncommon, a watering hole attack does pose a significant threat to websites, as these attacks are difficult to diagnose.</p>
          <p><u>What is it?</u></p>
          <ul>
              <li>The attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often uses and infects one or more of them with malware.</li>
              <li>Hackers injects malicious programming code, often in JavaScript or HTML. The code redirects the targeted groups to a different site where the malware or malvertisements are present. The malware is now ready to infect machines upon their access of the compromised website.</li>
              <li>Most users unknowingly provide the tracking information while browsing. The tracking information gives the behavioral web patterns of the targeted victim groups.</li>
              <li>It also indirectly provides the attackers with information about browsing, cloud services access and security policies of the organizations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The goal is to infect a targeted user's computer and gain access to the network at the target's place of employment.</p>

          <p><u>Example:</u></p>
          <p>Attack occurred in January, 2017, and it occurred at the same time in different places around the world.
            </p>
            <p>There were malicious JavaScript files that were installed onto these web servers, and they narrowed their focus to only provide the malicious JavaScript files if the people visiting that site were from some very specific IP address ranges.</p>


            <p><u>Who was affected?</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Polish Financial Supervision Authority was infected. The National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico was infected, and a state-owned bank in Uruguay was infected.</li>
              <li>Hackers knew that people would be visiting those locations from other banks and other financial organizations. And now that they have infected the watering hole, they were also able to infect people that were visiting the watering hole.</li>
              <li>Although there were machines that were blocked from this malicious tact, there were devices that did manage to get infected.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Impact:</u></p>
            <p>Authorities aren’t quite sure exactly what the extent of that infection ultimately resulted in, but it was a very good example of a well-honed attack occurring simultaneously across a very large geography.</p>

            <p><u>Prevention:</u> a good firewall, a good intrusion prevention system</p>

          <h2>Other major threats:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b><u>DDoS</u></b> - An attempt to take a website offline by overwhelming it with internet traffic. An attacker floods systems, servers, or networks with useless information exhausting resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests. By increase in the volume of traffic overloads the website and /or server becomes slow for legitimate users, sometimes to the point that the website or server shuts down completely disposing vulnerability.</li>
            <li><b><u>XSS</u></b> - Cross site scripting - Direct attack on a website's users. An attacker injects malicious code into visited website. For example, an attacker can embed a link to infected JS code in a comment on a blog. The infected code is designed to only target website's users and their browser, not the website itself.</li>
            <li><b><u>Zero-day-exploit</u></b> - A zero-day exploit hits after a network vulnerability is announced but before a patch or solution is implemented. Attackers target the disclosed vulnerability during this window of time.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS)</h2>
            <p>An attempt to take a website offline by overwhelming it with internet traffic. An attacker floods systems, servers, or networks with useless information exhausting resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfil legitimate requests. By increase in the volume of traffic overloads the website and /or server becomes slow for legitimate users, sometimes to the point that the website or server shuts down completely.</p>

            <p><u>Effect:</u></p>
            <p>Service disruption, which might lead to reputation damage, which leads to customer loss or even financial loss.</p>

            <p><u>Example:</u></p>
            <p>Attack on BBC in 2016</p>
            <ul>
              <li>reached 602Gpbs</li>
              <li>impact: disruption of service</li></ul>

            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p>This attack relays on poor personnel training and the trustfulness of people.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Email with subject line "Shipping information" or "Account deactivated" etc. They look like they came from trusted source and very often will include a link taking you to a website with a malware.</li>
              <li>Fake emails that look like they came from CEO asking you to fill in your sensitive information, e.g. tax form.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Malware – password attacks</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><u><b>Brute force</b></u> - guessing repeatedly for the password and check them again and again.</li>
              <li><u><b>Dictionary</b></u> - A hacker uses a program or script to try to login by cycling through combinations of common words. Generally, dictionary attacks succeed because many people tend to choose passwords which are short (7 characters or fewer).</li>
              <li><u><b>Keylogger</b></u> - often called keyboard capturing. It's a type of surveillance software used to monitor and record each keystroke.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Example:</u></p>
            <p>eBay attack in 2014</p>
            <ul>
              <li>145 million users compromised exposing names, addresses, dates of birth, encrypted passwords.</li>
              <li>Hackers got into eBay's network using credentials of 3 employees and had access for 229 days. </li>
              <li>Impact: decline in user activities</li>
            </ul>

      <header>How attacks against companies are designed to work</header>
        <article>
          <p>In order to explain how attacks are designed against companies we need to understand motives behind hacking activity and the types of hackers. </p>

          <p><u><b>Types of hackers:</b></u></p>
           <ul>
             <li><u><b>White hat</b></u> known as ethical hackers, so good guys. White hat hackers usually work in cyber security field helping organisations to prevent cyber-attack, ensure protection from black hat hackers or help to remove virus or ransomware. Very often white hat hackers work for government or similar organisation as penetration testers. Hence their job is to design an attack on their client in order test and identify loopholes in their cyber security to help prevent a real attack.</li>

             <li><u><b>Black hat</b></u> – known as crackers, so bad guys, people you hear about in the news.  The attack designed by a black hat will vary depending on their motivations. In most cases the attack is designed to steal and extort money, but they could also aim at stilling sensitive data, causing harm to individual or an organisation, disrupting service or gain some level of control. Black hat hackers look for vulnerabilities in computers, organisation systems or network.</li>

             <li><u><b>Grey hat</b></u> – they don’t use their skills for personal gain, but they don’t use them to do good either. For example, a grey hat hacker may hack into a dating website and leak its private communications over the internet or inform company about hack.</li>

             <li><u><b>Script Kiddie</b></u> – amateur hackers who don’t care much about the coding skills. They copy a malicious code or download software with a malicious intent. Their motivation is to impress friends or gain attention.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u><b>Example of an attack promoting political agenda:</b></u></p>
            <p>Facebook data breach in 2018, 50 million profiles were exploited. Attackers wanted to build a software program that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political adverts. The program could potentially predict or even affect the outcome of the elections. It is even implied that attackers have used Facebook platform to perpetrate information warfare against the US.</p>

            <p>The data was collected via an app called “thisisyourdigitallife”, which was built for academic use. Hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected. However, the app also collected data of the test-takers Facebook friends, exposing millions of profiles.</p>

            <p><u>Facts:</u></p>
            <p>Cambridge Analytica spent short of $1m on data collection. They built a database to put all the collected data into it. Then they created an algorithm to analyse individual behaviour linked to voting pattern. Combine, the algorithm and database created a very powerful tool that allowed to identify possible swing voters and design messages to persuade their vote.</p>

            <p><u>Companies and people involved</u></p>
            <p>Aleksander Kogan, an associate professor at St Petersburg State Uni also a researcher at Cambridge Uni, director of Global Science Research. Kogan received grant from the Russian government to research Facebook users’ emotional states. Kogan also made a commercial deal with SCL Elections LTD, which initially created Cambridge Analytica.</p>

      <header>A review of the hierarchy of damage and where major threats sit on it</header>
        <article>
            <p>It is important to know that the aspect of damage may vary, depending on cyber attack and organisation.</p>

            <p><u>Damage:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Physical damage to a computer, software or network.</li>
              <li>Well-being of an individual, e.g. cyber bulling or not feeling safe online.</li>
              <li>Financial damage, e.g. fines, revenue, ransomware, reimbursement to customers, etc. e.g. TalkTalk who was fined heavily for the data breach. </li>
              <li>Reputation damage, e.g. loss of customers, disruption of service leading to loss of customers, leak of sensitive information.</li>
              <li>Disruption of service, e.g. NHS, thousands of patient’s meetings and surgeries were cancelled and postponed.</li>
            </ul>

      <header>How Cyber Threats impact the Economy</header>
        <article>
            <p>Cyber attacks have negative impact on the economy.</p>
            <p>A global study that focuses on the impact cyber crime has on economies worldwide concludes that the cost of cyber crime is now up to 1% of global GBP (gross domestic product) equalling to $600bn a year. However not all cyber attacks are reported, so we might not have the real numbers.</p>

            <p><u>Impact:</u></p>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Financial loss</u> - incudes: operations expenses, cost of technology, costs preventing further harm, consultants and lawyers costs, fines, revenue loss, customer churn, staff productivity drops, future sales loses, e.g. NHS lost over £92m, TalkTalk £77m.</li>
              <li><u>Damage reputation</u> - cause loss of customers, sales and reduction in profit, e.g. TalkTalk.</li>
              <li><u>Disruption</u>, e.g. NHS thousands of cancelled appointments and surgeries.</li>
              <li><u>Legal consequences</u>, e.g. UBER</li>
            </ul>

              <p><u>Examples:</u></p>
              <p><b>TalkTalk hack</b></p>
              <p>DDoS attack carried out in 2015 by two man in their twenties, however analysis (done by BAE Systems) suggested there might have been up to 10 attackers involved.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>DDoS attack</u> – TalkTalk website was hit by waves of traffic so intense that it couldn’t cope, keeping the security team busy. Leaving a back door for attackers to go about their business.</li>
                <li><u>Effect of the attack:</u>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Damaged Reputation - TalkTalk share price dropped by 10% in the first few hours.</li>
                    <li>Financial loss - Possible costs of the attack was up to £77m.</li>
                    <li>Loss of customers - Possibly affected up to 157,000 customers.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>

                  <p><b>NHS hack</b></p>
                  <p>A global ransomware attack, known as WannaCry carried out in 2017, effected over 200,000 individuals, 10,000 organisations in over 150 countries and in the UK affecting NHS.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A ransomware attack locking users (e.g. NHS staff) out of their devices, shutting down computers around the world, also locking out medical equipment and other devices demanding the ransom payment. Luckily the attack was stopped on the same day, few hours later by a cyber researcher who activated the kill switch.</li>
                    <li><u>Effect of the attack:</u>
                      <ul>
                    <li>Disruption across the whole health and care sector, including: causing delays in discharge of patients, switching from electronic communications to pen and paper, unable to access electronic patients records, over 19,000 patients and surgery appointments were cancelled, GPs were delayed in receiving test results, patients needed to travel far for their appointments or needed to reschedule it.</li>
                    <li>Financial Loss – Possible costs of the attack was up to £92m. Initially it costs NHS £20m from the first 7 days of the attack and £72m in the subsequent clean-up and upgrades to its IT systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>

                  <p><b>Facebook Data Breach</b></p>
                  <p>Facebook data breach in 2018, 50 million profiles were exploited.

      <header>Threats that impact homes</header>
        <article>
          <p>“Home environments usually pick up a lot of flack from the internet”. There is a little value for an attacker to use control of home base systems, however it does happened.</p>

            <h2>Threats:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Phishing or Spear Phishing</u> – fraudulent emails, texts or being directed to fraudulent websites </li>
              <li><u>Malware</u> including spyware, adware, viruses, worms, Trojan horse. Software that infects your computer causing harm, damage and loss of data. It can also lead to ransomware for unlocking the data or your computer.
                <ul>
                  <li><u>Spyware & Adware</u> – software that collects personal info about you without your knowledge. Often being download and being installed automatically with or without your consent.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
              <li><u>Pharming</u> – points you to a malicious and illegitimate website by redirecting the URL. Even if entered correctly, it can still redirect you to a fake web convincing you that the web is legitimate by looking identical to the real site. As a result you might enter your logins and unknowingly give the access to hackers.</li>
              <li><u>Denial of service</u> - Attacker floods systems, servers, or networks with useless information exhausting resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests. By increase in the volume of traffic overloads the website or server becomes slow for legitimate users, sometimes to the point that the website or server shuts down completely disposing vulnerability.</li>
              <li>Hacking smart devices, eg: Alexa or Baby monitor</li>
            </ul>
